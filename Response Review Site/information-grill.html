        <h2>Our Wood-Fired Grilling Methods</h2>

        <p>
            At our restaurant, we take pride in our unique approach to grilling, utilizing wood-fired methods
            to infuse our dishes with exceptional flavor and character. Our chefs expertly craft each dish
            with a combination of carefully selected wood and precise grilling techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            The wood-fired grilling process begins with the selection of high-quality hardwoods, such as oak,
            hickory, or mesquite. These woods impart distinct flavors to our dishes, creating a smoky and
            aromatic experience that sets our grilled items apart.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our grilling methods involve using open flame grills and wood-burning ovens. This traditional
            approach ensures even cooking and imparts a delightful char to our meats, enhancing their
            natural flavors. The result is a menu that showcases the essence of wood-fired cooking.
