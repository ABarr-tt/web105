                    <p>I have been creating art for all of my life, some of my earliest memories are me drawing. As I grew my interests in art 
                        changed from drawing potato people, and little houses with little smokestacks, to comics and tattooing.</p>
                    <p>I have been making my own comics for years now, ever since I read my first one when I was five. I am obsessed with human
                        expression through motion, drawing anatomy and working on stories which challenge myself creatively. My favorite comics
                        as of now are: Invincible, Real, BLAME!, Hellboy, Do a Powerbomb, Berserk, The Climber, Fire Punch, One Piece, Dorohedoro
                        and Homonculus. These all have a very special place in my heart for varying reasons and are also varying levels of insanity.
                        I personally love comic stories that contain a story which leaves me lost, something I need to read a few times to fully grasp.
                        I try and take that and impliment it in my own stories and art, creating characters and plots which are complex in both physical
                        and conceptual design.

                        I also love tattoos, I love it for the artistic merit it has which I beleive has been overlooked for a very long time.
                        I beleive that tattoos are an extreme form of art, and a very personal form of art. I love the thought of two people,
                        artist and canvas, coming together to make one cohesive visual story. This story displays so much about the person wearing
                        the tattoos, and you can gain a lot of knowlegde about someone by just asking them what their tattoo means. This is the
                        reason I tend to lean more towards Japanese traditional tattooing. My personal favorite styles are American Traditional, 
                        Japanese Traditional, cybersigilism, and some new school / neo - tradiditonal. New school and cybersigilism, I enjoy for the
                        same reasons, they just look very nice (Even though cybersigilism breaks tattoo conventions and does not last). I enjoy
                        american traditional tattoos because they can look very good, they hold significance to some, I enjoy the patchwork structure
                        and they last. I enjoy Japanese Traditional the most as it is a better version of American traditional. The tattoo style has limitations,
                        people don't get tattooed past certain points, and the structure of it is much more like a painting, with the whole body being filled. 
                        The tattoos themselves must display some of the person's personality, beliefs or traditionally the gods they worship and what the person
                        aspires to be.
