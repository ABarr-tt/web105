                <p>I have always enjoyed music, I think you would be hard pressed to find someone who isnt, but it wasn't unitl high school
                    when I started to have my current level of appreciation. I had been listening to things like, funk, jazz and R&B for years,
                    I was talking to my friend Kevin about music and decided to give metal a chance. I was in a state where I was just getting 
                    into using a musical instrument,guitar, for the first time and was very open to new styles and I was absolutely taken by Iron Maiden.
                    The musical style of metal spoke to me, the drums were booming, guitars were intricate and the singing was electric. Everything
                    was taken to the extreme and I felt it was filled to the brim with passion and love for the style. Metal when I had first listened
                    to it felt like nothig i had ever experienced in my life, I immediately knew it was something that will stay with me forever.
                    Once I had started to play guitar a year later, I would spend hours a day trying my best to replicate the sounds I heard in 
                    my favorite songs. I have never stopped playing guitar and listening to metal since eighth grade when I had first gotten into it.
                    To me Metal music is a beautiful expression of love, music taken to the limits of itself for the love of metal. I personally 
                    use metal music to deal with my own emotions, to create visual art, and to relax. It produces a wonderful image through sound and 
                    emotional feel and it is a major influence in my life which brings me happiness.

                    My favorite band is trivium and I have been a fan since I was sixteen, since I started listening to them my life has been influenced
                    in multiple ways. I have bonded with friends, met new people, experienced new things related to music, gotten better at guitar, been 
                    influenced in art, and gotten through tough situations through self - expression. I love the sound (for the most part, some albums are awful),
                    I love the songwriting and the band makes me aspire to do better as a guitarist.
