                    <p>Hello everyone!!!</p>
                    <p>My name is Aidan Barrett, the curly-haired guy in all the pictures, I'm here to introduce myself a little!
                        I'll start off with my family, I have a massive family with 7 siblings and 8 nieces and nephews, as you can probably tell
                         I'm not directly related. I was married into this family with my mom and biological sister (neither of them look like me either, 
                         kinda ironic).</p>
                    <p> I tend to have a lot of hobbies and interests; in general though I would say I am best at art, physicality, and programming
                         - related topics. For art I love to express myself in music through guitar, art in drawing, painting and tattoos with a big
                          focus on comics and other visual stories. For physical things I enjoy working out and dedicating myself to stay in fighting
                           shape, though I've taken the past few months to stay away from the gym and keep myself happy before returning. As for
                            programming - related topics; I love to teach myself new things, though this is more universal than just applied to
                             programmng. I dabble in electrical engineering and creating little engineering or woodworking projects. I've been
                              practicing programing in my free time outside of class for the past two years.</p>

                    <p> My current goal in college is to develop my skills in web development and finish up my associates degree, which I should 
                        accomplish by this summer! During my time in this college I plan on using the small - town culture to advertise myself
                         and create a portfolio to get myself into a company instead of freelancing work. I plan on entering the job market 
                         immediately after the summer and finishing my bachelor's over the next five years from there. I want to accomplish all
                          this to create a life for myself where I can work online and travel; my big goal in life is learning and I want to
                           travel the world to deepen my understanding of life</p>
